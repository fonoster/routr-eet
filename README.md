SEET is a suite for end-to-end testing of SIP deployments. We are currently only covering some very basic scenarios, but we are looking into to adding useful artifacts to help test and troubleshoot any SIP device or software. SEET is inspired in [pysipp](https://github.com/SIPp/pysipp).

## Test environment

Add the following domain names to the `/etc/hosts`

`sp.provider.com`
